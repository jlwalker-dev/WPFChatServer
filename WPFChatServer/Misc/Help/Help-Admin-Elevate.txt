Elevate Command Help
-----------------------------------

/ELEVATE <password>

    Used to elevate a registered user to system administration level.
    Like many commands, the elevate command is a toggle switch so if
    you elevate a person who is a system admin, that right is taken
    away from them.

    The password to elevate a user is stored in the Registration 
    configuration file.  If the password is less than eight characters
    in length, it is considered invalid and the elevate command will
    not work.

    If the Registration configuration file is not present, it will be
    created with an invalid password that can be changed with a text editor.
