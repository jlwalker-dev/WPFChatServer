/CHANGE RECORD ON|OFF

    --- NOT IMPLEMENTED AT THIS TIME ---

Notes

    The record command will record everything that is said or occurs in a room.  Recordings
    are saved in the format YYYYMMDD-ROOMNAME.TXT and are automatically deleted after a
    period of time.

    A new set of commands would need to be added to deal with the recordings and to allow
    people to either read or have them sent to an email address.

    The current command/response system is not well suited to reading a long text file so
    this would require some thought on how to handle it.
