Change Password Help
-----------------------------------

/CHANGE PASSWORD <password>

    Add/update the password for the room.  If a user enters a room
    with a password, and there are private seats available, then they
    are assigned to a private seat.

    Private seats are only useful if the privacy setting is set to
    something higher than 0 (open to the public).
