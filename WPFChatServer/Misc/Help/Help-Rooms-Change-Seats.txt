Change Seats Help
-----------------------------------

/CHANGE SEATS <seat info>
    There are three types of seats in a room.  Public, private, and
    speaker.  Speaker seats are not used unless you are setting up
    a forum room.

    Public seats are taken up by anyone entering the room without a password 
    or being on a white list.  Private seats are taken up by someone entering 
    with the password assigned to the room.  Speaker seats are taken by users 
    who enter and are on the speaker white list.

    When a room is first created, the seating is set up as 20 public seats and
    no private or speaker seats.

    Defining seats are done in the following format: 20/10/0 which are in the
    order of public/private/speaker.  If the room has speaker seats, then
    people in public seats cannot participate in discussions, only listen.
    Additionally, people in private seats can only submit questions to the
    room's Q&A board.

    Admin and moderators can always speak, no matter what seat they occupy.
    
    Example: /CHANGE SEATS 10/20/0
        Set up 10 public seats and 20 private seats.  If the room's privacy 
        setting is 0, then evryone can talk.  If the room's privacy setting
        is not 1 or 2, then nobody can occupy public seating.
