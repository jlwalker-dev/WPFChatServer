Away Command Help
-----------------------------------

/AWAY <message>
    Sets your away message which is immediately sent to everyone in the current room
    and if someone contacts you via a private message.  Entering the away command
    without a message clears your current away message.  You cannot send a message
    to anyone while your away message is set.

Note
   When a person is away, their timeout might be set to a longer period of time.
