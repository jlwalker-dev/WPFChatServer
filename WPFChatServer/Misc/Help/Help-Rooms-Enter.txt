Enter Command Help
-----------------------------------

/ENTER <RoomName>
    This command is used by registered users to enter other chat rooms
    listed in the system or to create a new chat room.  If the room
    does not exist, the room is created.

    If a room has a saved profile, then only the room admin or a moderator
    can load the room for use and a room with the same name will not
    be created by the ENTER command.

    The person who creates a room with the enter command becomes the room
    administrator and can save the room profile using the RMSAVE command.

End of ENTER help.
