BAN Command Help
-----------------------------------

/BAN <user> <message>
    Bans the user from the room and they are no longer permitted to
    enter the room until they are removed from the ban list.  The
    optional message will be given to the user.  The /BAN ? command
    returns a list of everyone who's currently banned for this room.

    If a person is already on the ban list, entering them with the
    BAN command will take them off the list.

    The BAN list is provided each time you use the BAN command.

    The BAN command will not kick someone from a room, it will only
    prevent them from entering it.  Once a person is on the ban list
    you can use the kick command to remove them from the room.

End BAN help.
