Room Help
-----------------------------------

Rooms are areas where people can gather and talk amungst themselves about specific 
topics, just like in the real world. If you enter a room, then everything you say 
stays in that room unless you send a private message, which will be delivered to 
the recipient no matter what room they are currently in.

Anyone can create a new room by simply using the /ENTER command and giving a unique 
room name.  When you create a room, you automatically become the administrator of 
that room.  As long as someone stays in the room, the room will exist.  When the last 
person leaves the room, the room will dissapear.

The following commands are related to room use:

/BAN      - Ban a user from the room or get a list of banned uses

/ENTER    - Create a room, or if it already exists then enter the room

/CHANGE   - Admins can change the room's seating capacity and other properties

/FORUM    - Start or end a forum session

/IGNORE   - Ignore someone in the same room

/KICK     - An admin or moderator can kick someone from a room

/MSG      - Send a private message to someone in this or another room

/RMINFO   - Lists room information

/RMLOAD   - Load a room profile and enter it

/RMSAVE   - Save a room profile

/ROOMS    - Returns a list of all rooms on the system

To get help on a command, use the /HELP command.  
   Example: /HELP ENTER gets help for the /ENTER command.
