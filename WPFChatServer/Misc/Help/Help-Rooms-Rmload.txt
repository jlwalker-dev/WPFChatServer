RMLOAD Help
-----------------------------------

/RMLOAD <room profile> [<new name>]

    This command allows you to load a room profile, optionally under
    a different room name if the profile is not password protected.

    A room profile contains information on the owner/administrator, any
    moderators, room password, seating, and banned users.  A room cannot
    be loaded by anyone who is not the administrator or a moderator. A room
    can be loaded under a different room name, by anyone if it is not password 
    protected, be modified and then saved as that new room.

    A saved room must be loaded before it can be entered, so that means that
    someone cannot create a room that already has a saved profile.
