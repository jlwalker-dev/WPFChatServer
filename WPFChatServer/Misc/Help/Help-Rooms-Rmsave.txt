RMSAVE Help
-----------------------------------

/RMSAVE

    This command allows the room administrator to save a room profile.
    The profile is saved in a data file of the same name as the room.

    A room profile contains information on the owner/administrator, any
    moderators, room password, seating, and banned users.  A room cannot
    be saved by anyone who is not the administrator.

    A saved room must be loaded before it can be entered, so that means that
    someone cannot create a room that already has a saved profile.
