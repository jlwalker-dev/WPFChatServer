Ignore Command
-----------------------------------

/IGNORE <nick>
    Toggles ignoring any messages from the user with the indicated nickname.
    It will make no difference if the user changes their nickname, their group
    messages will not be shown to you.  You can not ignore private messages.

    If you do not enter a nickname after the ignore command, you will clear your
    ignore list.
