Reg Command Help
-----------------------------------

/REG <email>/<username>/<nickname>/<password>/<fullname>
    Allows you to register with the chat server.  Enter your information
    seperated by a forward slash.  An example would be:

    /REG <JSmith@gmail.com>/JSmith/John/ABC123/John Q Smith

    When you enter the REG command, the system break out your information
    and lists it for you.  Once you are satisfied, send the /REG SAVE
    command to save your registration.

    After saving, a verification code will be sent to your email address
    and you can use the verify command to complete the process.
