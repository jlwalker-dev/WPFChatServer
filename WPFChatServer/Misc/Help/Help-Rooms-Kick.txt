Kick Command Help
-----------------------------------

/KICK <email|username|nickname> <message>
    Allows a room admin or moderator kick somebody back to the LOBBY.
    An optional message can be delivered to the person kicked as to
    why they were kicked out.  The kick command is temporary and the
    user can immediately return to the room unless they are on the
    BAN list.
