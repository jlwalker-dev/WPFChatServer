UserRights Help - System Admin
-----------------------------------

/USERRIGHTGS <email|username|nick> <rights list>

    Allows the system admin to change a users rights.  The rights list is a 
    series of values seperated by the forward slash.  An example might 
    be "/CREATE/SINGLE/GROUP/".

    The unmodified system does not recognize any special rights other than
    the ADMIN right and the USERRIGHTS command cannot be used to enter or
    remove the ADMIN right.

    At this time, this command will simply fill the rights field with characters
    that can be used once the chat server is modified to recognize them.  Each
    time you enter a list of rights, it overwrites the list (except for ADMIN).

Thoughts on Future Use

    This command might be used to control who can create a room, or provide
    further control of rooms like who can save/load a room.

    Could add control on who has rights to send private messages or be allowed
    to set an away message with longer timeouts.

    Could be used to create a System Moderator who has ability to modify user
    information and mark room profiles as unacceptable which sets the room
    to room admin entry only with message as to what the problem is so room admin 
    can make changes.
