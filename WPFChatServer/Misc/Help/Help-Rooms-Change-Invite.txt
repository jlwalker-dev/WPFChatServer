Change Invite Help
-----------------------------------

/CHANGE INVITE <nick>

    --- NOT IMPLEMENTED ---

    Adds a user to the room's white list.  When a person tries to enter
    a private room, they either need a password or to be on the white
    list.  When a room is set in forum mode, meaning there are speaker
    seats set up, a person on the whitelist takes one of the speaker
    seats when they try to enter without a password.

    If the room is set to private/password or private/whitelist then
    a user on the whitelist can entering the room without a password.

    If you perform an invite command on someone who is on the whitelist, it
    takes them off the whitelist.


/CHANGE INVITE ?
    Returns a list of those people on the whitelist.


End of Invite help.
