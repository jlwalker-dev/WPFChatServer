Forum Command Help
-----------------------------------

/FORUM [START|END]

    A forum room is a room that has speaker seats.  When you start a
    forum, nobody can talk publicly except speakers, the room admin, and 
    room moderators.

    When a forum has been started, the system will not announce when people
    enter or leave the room.
